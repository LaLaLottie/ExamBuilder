# ExamBuilder
A class group project (CS 342) and these files are my contributions.  These are not all of the files included in the project nor only the files I contributed code.

This Java project is a program that allows instructors to create exams using an exam builder.  The resulting exam is able to be modified by instructors and taken by students.  The exam builder can also grade existing exams.
